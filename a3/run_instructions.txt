__Exercise 1, how to run:
Go into folder: Exercise1, and execute "make"
then use "./main" [Amount of threads] [Maximum value in range]
./main 8 100000


__Exercise 2, how to run:
Go into folder: Exercise2, and execute "make"
then use "./gol" [Array dimension] [Time steps] [Amount of threads]\n"
example: ./gol 100000 4 8


__Exercise 3, how to run:
Go into folder: Exercise3, and execute "make all"

1) for No pruning: then use 
./Merge_sortNP [Array dimension] [Amount of threads]
example: ./Merge_sortNP 100000000 8

2) for Pruning: then use 
./Merge_sortP  [Array dimension] [Amount of threads] [Threshold]
example: ./Merge_sortP 100000000 8 2

3) for One task spawn incl Pruning use:
./Merge_sortS  [Array dimension] [Amount of threads] [Threshold]
example: ./Merge_sortS 100000000 8 2
